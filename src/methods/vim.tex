\subsection{Search and Replace}
\begin{longtable}{l l}
    \verb|v/pattern/d| & delete every line not matching the pattern \\
    \verb|g/pattern/d| & delete every line matching pattern \\
    \verb|s/pattern/subst/flag| & substitute pattern with string,
                                  flag to specify how\\
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Vim-regex}

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}| p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \verb~\{-}~ & similar to .*, except that it is not greedy. The hyphen can also
    be of form n,m where n denotes the minimal,maximum count respecitvely. \\
    \hline

    \verb~Prefix_pattern\zsMid_pattern\zeSuffix_pattern~
    & where:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Prefix pattern] is a part of the match we do \textit{not} care about.
            This is delimited by \verb~\zs~ (pattern begin).
        \item[Midpattern] is what we are replacing. This is because of the
            \verb~\zs~ and \verb~\ze~ surrounding.
        \item[Suffix pattern] will also not be replaced because of \verb~\ze~.
    \end{description}
    Note that \verb~\ze~ and \verb~\zs~ can be used individually.
\end{tabular}


\subsubsection{Examples}

\begin{longtable}{l l}
    delete every line not matching format 0.00 0.099, and keep newlines & 
    \verb~%s/^$/AB0\.1/g | v/[0-9]\./d | %s/AB0\.1//g~ \\
    delete trailing whitespace & \verb~ %s/\s\+$//g~ \\
    leading & \verb~%s/^\s\+//g~ \\
\end{longtable}
