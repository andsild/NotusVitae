const <C>\& function { return FOO; }
means it will return a constant reference to C

<C>\& function const { return FOO; }
means it will not modify any data in C.


std::vector<T> will typically allocate space in $2^{n}$, where n is minimal.
Whenever n increases, a new buffer is allocated, which means that it will
have to iterate over all it's former elements - giving ${2^n+1}$ iterations.
Hence, one should pre-allocate the space needed when possible.

Whenever you use cout to output something, ostream buffers it but does not send
it to the output device immediately. Only when the buffer is flushed will the
output get sent to the destination. This can cause trouble if e.g.\
the buffer is full (usually 512 bytes).
