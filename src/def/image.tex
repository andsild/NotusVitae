\section{Image Processing}

\begin{definition}[Anisotropic diffusion]
    also called Perona-Malik diffusion, is a technique aiming at reducing image
    noise without removing significant parts of the image content, typically
    edges, lines or other details that are important for the interpretation of
    the image.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[extrapolation]
    The process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value
    of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable.

    Creating a tangent line at the end of the known data and extending it
    beyond that limit.

\end{definition}



\begin{definition}[Gaussian blur]
    Use a gaussian function on an image to reduce image noise and detail
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Gaussian filter]
    Gaussian filters have the properties of having no overshoot to a step
    function input while minimizing the rise and fall time.

\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Gradient flow]
    $$
        V = \nabla{f} = \left(\
        \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_{1}}},
        \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_{2}}},
        \dots,
        \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_{n}}}
    \right)
    $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Image gradient]
    Gradual blend of color
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Image noise]
    Unwanted signal, electrical signals not wanted in an image
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Image masking]
    Apply an image over another. This can be used for e.g.\ putting a square image
    with only contents in the middle over another.
\end{definition}



\begin{definition}[Poisson image editing]
    Blend two images together and make them seem alike.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Raster order]
    Begin at top left, proceed to right, then at leftmost pixel in next line.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Raster image]
    An image with pixels.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Scalar field]\label{scalarfield}
    Associate a value to every point in a space. E.g.\ for an image, you
    could assign each pixel a color value.
\end{definition}
