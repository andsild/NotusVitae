\begin{definition}[Corner point feasible solution(CPF]
A solution that lies at the corner of a feasible region (solution space)
If a solution has only one feasible solution, it must be a CPF
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Feasile region]
    Aka solution space. The set of all valid solutions, i.e. those that do not
    violate constraints.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Slope-intercept form]
    Instead of expressing an objective function, show it as
    an expression of your parameters. (e.g. $x_{1}, c_{i,j}$)
\end{definition}
