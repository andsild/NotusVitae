        \item $\cos{(\arcsin{x}} = \sin{(\arccos{x})} = \sqrt{1-x^{2}}{}$
        \item $ x = -1 \rightarrow \arcsin{x} = -1\times\frac{\pi}{2}$
        \item $ x = 1 \rightarrow \arcsin{x} = \frac{\pi}{2}$
        \item $ x = 0 \rightarrow \arcsin{x} = 0$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Convolution]
    Dictionary: a coil or twist, especially one of many.\newline
    Informal: an expression of how a shape from one function is modified by 
        the other.

    Can also be used to smoothen a discontinous a function (making it continous 
    on the given range). We need to normalize our g(x - $\tau$) so that we do
    not continously increase the f(x)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous]
In mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which
"small" changes in the input result in "small" changes in the output.

As an example, consider the function h(t), which describes the height of a
growing flower at time t. This function is continuous. By contrast, if M(t)
denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time t, then the function
jumps whenever money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function M(t) is
discontinuous.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous variables]
    There are three types of continuous variables:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Nominal] Categorized within groups: box 1, 2, 3 or 4.
        \item[Dichotomous] Boolean, yes or no.
        \item[Ordinal] A nominal variable, just that different groups give
            different values. E.g.\ to like something on a scale of 1 to 10
            gives you a ordinal range
    \end{description}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Conjugate]
     is a binomial formed by negating the second term of a binomial. The
     conjugate of $x + y$ is $x − y$.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Concave]
    Let $f$ be a function defined on the interval $[x_{1}, x_{2}]$.
    This function is concave according to the definition if, for every pair of
    numbers a and b with $x_{1} \leq a \leq x_{2}$ and $x_{1} \leq b \leq
    x_{2}$, the line segment from $(a,  f (a))$ to $(b,  f (b))$
    lies on or below the function.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sine function is concave on the interval $[0, \pi]$
        \item Concave if every line segment joining two point is never above
              the graph 
        \item Concave functions has $f\prime\prime(x) \leq 0$ in a given
              interval 
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Damping]

    list of coefficients of a finite combination of complex sinusoids, ordered
    by their frequencies, that has those same sample values.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Discrete Sine Transform]

\begin{definition}[Discretization]
    concerns the process of transferring
    continuous models and equations into discrete counterparts. 
    AKA\ smoothening curves to avoid jumps.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Divergence]\label{divergence}
    measures the magnitude of a~\nameref{vectorfield}'s source or sink at a
    given point, in terms of a signed scalar.

    E.g.\ air can be thought of to have a point $s \text{ and } t$, where they
    push out hot and cool air, respectively. From these points, you can create
    a~\nameref{vectorfield} that shows how air spreads from $s \text{ and }
    t$. The divergence measures the collected value from each of 
    these~\nameref{vectorfield}s.

    The operator for divergence is \verb|{div}|, represented by nabla.

    Given vector field $F = Ui, Vj, Wk$:
    \begin{align}
            div \textbf{F} = \nabla \cdot F = 
            \frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{x}}+
            \frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{y}} +
            \frac{\partial{W}}{\partial{z}}
    \end{align}

\end{definition}

    The difference in a function for $f(x + a) - f(x + b)$.

    There are three types:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Forward] is of the form $\bigtriangleup{f}(x) = f(x + h) - f(x)$
        \item[Backward] is of the form $\nabla{f}(x) = f(x) - f(x - h)$
        \item[Centered] is of the form $\delta{f}(x) = f(x + \frac{1}{2}h) - f(x - \frac{1}{2}h)$
    \end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Finite element method]
    (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to
    boundary value problems for differential equations. It uses variational
    methods (the calculus of variations) to minimize an error function and
    produce a stable solution.  Analogous to the idea that connecting many tiny
    straight lines can approximate a larger circle, FEM encompasses all the
    methods for connecting many simple element equations over many small
    subdomains, named finite elements, to approximate a more complex equation
    over a larger domain.

        v \cdot u = |v||u|\cos{\theta} \\
    \end{align*}
    Note that if $v, u$ are unit vectors, their lengths are both 1.
    We can then rewrite the expression as
    \begin{align*}
        v \cdot u &= \cos{\theta} \\
        \arccos{(v \cdot u)} &= \theta
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

    is the parametric representation of a unit circle.

\begin{definition}[Partial derivative]
