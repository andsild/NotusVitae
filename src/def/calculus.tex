    Informal: an expression of how a shape from one function is modified by 
        the other.

    Can also be used to smoothen a discontinous a function (making it continous 
    on the given range). We need to normalize our g(x - $\tau$) so that we do
    not continously increase the f(x)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous]
In mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which
"small" changes in the input result in "small" changes in the output.

As an example, consider the function h(t), which describes the height of a
growing flower at time t. This function is continuous. By contrast, if M(t)
denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time t, then the function
jumps whenever money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function M(t) is
discontinuous.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Continuous variables]
    There are three types of continuous variables:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Nominal] Categorized within groups: box 1, 2, 3 or 4.
        \item[Dichotomous] Boolean, yes or no.
        \item[Ordinal] A nominal variable, just that different groups give
            different values. E.g.\ to like something on a scale of 1 to 10
            gives you a ordinal range
    \end{description}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Conjugate]
     is a binomial formed by negating the second term of a binomial. The
     conjugate of $x + y$ is $x − y$.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Concave]
    Let $f$ be a function defined on the interval $[x_{1}, x_{2}]$.
    This function is concave according to the definition if, for every pair of
    numbers a and b with $x_{1} \leq a \leq x_{2}$ and $x_{1} \leq b \leq
    x_{2}$, the line segment from $(a,  f (a))$ to $(b,  f (b))$
    lies on or below the function.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sine function is concave on the interval $[0, \pi]$
        \item Concave if every line segment joining two point is never above
              the graph 
        \item Concave functions has $f\prime\prime(x) \leq 0$ in a given
              interval

    % \begin{bmatrix}   
    %     0 & 1 & 0 \\  
    %     1 & -4 & 1 \\ 
    %     0 & 1 & 0

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Divergence]\label{divergence}
    measures the magnitude of a~\nameref{vectorfield}'s source or sink at a
    given point, in terms of a signed scalar.

    E.g.\ air can be thought of to have a point $s \text{ and } t$, where they
    push out hot and cool air, respectively. From these points, you can create
    a~\nameref{vectorfield} that shows how air spreads from $s \text{ and }
    t$. The divergence measures the collected value from each of 
    these~\nameref{vectorfield}s.

    The operator for divergence is \verb|{div}|, represented by nabla.

    Given vector field $F = Ui, Vj, Wk$:
    \begin{align}
            div \textbf{F} = \nabla \cdot F = 
            \frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{x}}+
            \frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{y}} +
            \frac{\partial{W}}{\partial{z}}
    \end{align}

\end{definition}

    In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable built
    from a finite number of exponentials, logarithms, constants, and $nth$ roots
    through composition and combinations using the four elementary operations
    $(+ – × ÷)$.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Expansion function]

        \item[Backward] is of the form $\nabla{f}(x) = f(x) - f(x - h)$
        \item[Centered] is of the form $\delta{f}(x) = f(x + \frac{1}{2}h) - f(x - \frac{1}{2}h)$
    \end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Finite element method]
    (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to
    boundary value problems for differential equations. It uses variational
    methods (the calculus of variations) to minimize an error function and
    produce a stable solution.  Analogous to the idea that connecting many tiny
    straight lines can approximate a larger circle, FEM encompasses all the
    methods for connecting many simple element equations over many small
    subdomains, named finite elements, to approximate a more complex equation
    over a larger domain.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Filter bank]

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Heavyside Step Function]

    H(x) = \left\{
            \begin{array}{l l}
                0 & \text{for} x < 0 \\
                \frac{1}{2} & x = 0 \\
                1 & \text{for} x > 0 \\
            \end{array}
        \right.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Integral]
    The ``reverse'' to a derivate. 

    \begin{align}
        \int_{a}^{b}x^{n} dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \\

    Input a function, and output another (using integrals).
    To do the transformation, one typically usues a \textit{kernel function} (e.g.\ 
    using a stencil in a grid).

    Usually, this is done to find a domain or function that is easier to compute
    on. 

    After completing the computations, one performs an inverse integral transform

        \arccos{(v \cdot u)} &= \theta
    \end{align*}

    is the parametric representation of a unit circle.

\begin{definition}[Partial derivative]
    Given a function $f$ with multiple parameters, a partial derivative is a
    derivative with respect to one of those variables.

    Partial derivatives are often denoted by $\partial$.

        \right.
    $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Reference value]

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sine wave]
or sinusoid is a mathematical curve that describes a smooth repetitive
oscillation.

Its most basic form as a function of time $(t)$ is:

$y(t) = A\sin(2 \pi f t + \varphi) = A\sin(\omega t + \varphi)$
where:
\begin{description}
    \item[A], the amplitude, is the peak deviation of the function from zero.
    \item[f], the ordinary frequency, is the number of oscillations (cycles)
        that occur each second of time.
    \item[ω] = 2πf, the angular frequency, is the rate of change of the
    function argument in units of radians per second 
    \item[$\varphi$], the phase, specifies (in radians) where in its cycle the
        oscillation is at t = 0. I.e.\ the ``horizontal shift'' from a regular
        sine wave(????).
    If you e.g.\ represent two functions, $f(x) = \sin{x}$ and $g(x) = \sin{x} + 3$
    , the difference, i.e.\ phase shift, is 3. Note that these two functions
    have the same amplitude and frequency.

    \begin{align}
        x(t) &= y(t) \\
        x(t + \delta) &= y(t + \delta)
    \end{align}

    One example is the derivative function of polynomials (and others?) -
    no matter what timestep you choose - the value if the same.

    The ``antonym'' would be a time variant system.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Translation invariant system]
    A system such that after a translation from A to T, any operator
    applied to A yields the same results in T.
