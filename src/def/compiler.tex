\begin{definition}[Control Stack]\label{def:staticmemory}
    Where procedure calls and returns go. Each function typically has
    its own frame. We call such a frame for a funciton an activation record.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Live Variable]\label{def:livevariable}
    A variable which holds a value that might be read. If a value is assigned
    to but never used again it is not in the out-set of a block in a control
    flow graph.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Static Memory]\label{def:staticmemory}
    Where globals and metadata for programs go.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Static Memory]\label{def:staticmemory}
    Where globals and metadata for programs go. Static is always known at
    compile time.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{notes}
If you can construct a table with FIRST and FOLLOW and there are no
conflicts, grammar is $LL(1)$. That is, for a nonterminal, $FIRST(\alpha) \cap FIRST(\beta) = \emptyset$, for any pair of production-rules $\alpha$ and $\beta$ where the leftmost-derivation is different (i.e., they do not result in the same string). If any production rule $\alpha$ A $\xRightarrow{*} \epsilon$, then the rule extends such that $FIRST(A) \cap FOLLOW(A) = \emptyset$
