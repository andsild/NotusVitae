\section{Algorithms}
The performance guarantee of a primal-dual algorithm provides an upper bound
on the~\nameref{integralitygap} of an integer programmin formulation.
The~\nameref{integralitygap} also gives a lower bound on the performance
guarantee that can be achieved via a standard primal-dual and analysys.

Primal dual is good for when there might be exponential problem sizes in the
inout.

General method:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine decisions
    \item Define the value of making those deciosion
    \item Decide bounds on OPT
    \item Prove that decision bound OPT by $\alpha$
\end{enumerate}
